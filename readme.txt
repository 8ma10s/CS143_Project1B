Our project implements the following features:
1) A search feature that is available on any page, and leads to a page listing links to matching movies and actors. The search feature supports multi-word search.
2) A page to add actors and directors to the database.
3) A page to add movies, along with all of their information, to the database.
4) A page to add "actor to movie" relations to the database.
5) A page that lets users add "director to movie" relations to the database.
6) An actor page that shows information about an actor, and lists all of the movies and roles the actor has been featured in.
7) A movie information page that displays information about the movie, and lists all of the actors and roles in the movie. Users can submit reviews (ratings and comments) on the movie page. The average score of the reviews for a certain movie is shown at the top of the reviews section.

In our team, we each implemented roughly the same number of functional "pages", but since the search "add" pages were more challenging, Ben templated the HTML pages to compensate for only working on the easier queries and pages.

We collaborated on the project using a git repository hosted on Github. The main aspect we could improve on in a team setting is task assignment. We could use a shared "to do" list and each mark what we are working on and what we will do next. Instead of doing this, we took a very casual approach and each partner just worked on whatever part of the project they felt like when they had time.
